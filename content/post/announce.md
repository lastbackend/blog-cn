这是为Last.Backend撰写的最重要的博客文章。 我们很高兴发布一个平台的新版本，为此我们已付出了很长时间的努力 - **Last.Backend 今天正式开源**!

这意味着在不久的将来Last.Backend云平台即将发布。 Last.Backend云平台是在Kubernetes之上构建的PaaS。 它旨在帮助开发人员编写优秀的基于云的应用程序，而无需担心管理底层基础设施。

Our Platform doing all routine infrastructure work for you. It is an end-2-end solution: **from code to app in the cloud**. We are developing an open-source platform each can use today.

We are making last changes before soft launch our cloud solution. 
It is based on top of our open-source platform but powered with new material style dashboard and other infrastructure critical tools.
Our bare-metal servers located around the world and waiting for your apps.
